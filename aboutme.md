# About Me

Hello, I'm Mina Arzaghi, a passionate and dedicated individual with a strong background in Data Science and Machine Learning. Currently, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. at HEC Montreal, specializing in the exciting field of Data Science. My research focuses on the critical topic of Trustworthy Machine Learning, particularly delving into Algorithmic Fairness within Recommender Systems.

## Ph.D. Research

In my Ph.D. journey, I am exploring the intricate landscape of Trustworthy Machine Learning. My primary research interest lies in the realm of Algorithmic Fairness, a crucial aspect of modern machine learning systems. Specifically, I am investigating how to ensure fairness and equity in Recommender Systems, where recommendations play a significant role in influencing user decisions. By identifying and addressing bias and discrimination in these systems, I aim to contribute to the creation of more inclusive and ethical technology.

## Professional Background

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I had the privilege to work in the real-world application of Data Science. As an R&D Data Scientist in a Financial Organization, I had the opportunity to tackle the intricate challenges of algorithmic fairness within tabular data. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between academic research and practical implementation, honing my skills in turning data-driven insights into tangible solutions.

## Teaching and Academic Engagement

My journey in the world of Data Science extends beyond research and into education. Since 2017, I have been fortunate to serve as a lecturer at HEC Montreal. I have had the privilege of teaching and developping Data Science and Machine Learning courses to both undergraduate and graduate students. Guiding and inspiring the next generation of data scientists has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and I continue to foster a passion for learning and discovery within my students.
