# About Me
Hello, I'm Mina Arzaghi, a Ph.D. student in Data Science at HEC Montreal, specializing in Trustworthy Machine Learning. Under the expert guidance of Prof. [Jean-Fran√ßois Plante](https://www.hec.ca/en/profs/jfplante.html) and Prof. [Golnoosh Farnadi](https://gfarnadi.github.io/), my research focuses on Algorithmic Fairness within Large Language Models. With several years of experience teaching data science courses, especially machine learning, and a background as a data scientist in the financial field, I bring a practical and informed perspective to my academic research.



<!-- ## Ph.D. Research-->

## Professional Background

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as an R&D Data Scientist in the finance sector, focusing on algorithmic fairness, particularly with structured data. This role helped me understand how to apply academic theories to real-world problems and enhanced my ability to transform complex data into actionable solutions.

Additionally, I have a background in project management, particularly in large-scale projects such as those in the petroleum sector. This background supports my data science endeavors, allowing me to approach problems with a practical mindset and craft effective solutions.

## Teaching and Academic Engagement

My journey in the world of Data Science extends beyond research and into education. Since 2017, I have been fortunate to serve as a lecturer at HEC Montreal. I have had the privilege of teaching and developping Data Science and Machine Learning courses to both undergraduate and graduate students.
