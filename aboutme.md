# About Me
Hello, I'm Mina Arzaghi, a Ph.D. student in Data Science at HEC Montreal, specializing in Trustworthy Machine Learning. Under the expert guidance of Prof. [Jean-Fran√ßois Plante](https://www.hec.ca/en/profs/jfplante.html) and Prof. [Golnoosh Farnadi](https://gfarnadi.github.io/), my research focuses on Algorithmic Fairness within Large Language Models. With several years of experience teaching data science courses, especially machine learning, and a background as a data scientist in the financial field, I bring a practical and informed perspective to my academic research.



## Ph.D. Research

In my Ph.D. journey, I am exploring the intricate landscape of Trustworthy Machine Learning. My primary research interest lies in the realm of Algorithmic Fairness, a crucial aspect of modern machine learning systems. Specifically, I am investigating how to ensure fairness and equity in Recommender Systems, where recommendations play a significant role in influencing user decisions. By identifying and addressing bias and discrimination in these systems, I aim to contribute to the creation of more inclusive and ethical technology.

Currently, I am further expanding my expertise as a Research Intern at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), working under the guidance of Prof. [Golnoosh Farnadi](https://gfarnadi.github.io/). My focus lies in addressing ethical challenges within conversational recommender systems, where I am delving into the intricacies of ensuring responsible and unbiased AI-driven interactions. 

## Professional Background

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I had the privilege to work in the real-world application of Data Science. As an R&D Data Scientist in a Financial Organization, I had the opportunity to tackle the intricate challenges of algorithmic fairness within tabular data. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between academic research and practical implementation, honing my skills in turning data-driven insights into tangible solutions.
Drawing from my previous experiences in project management, including roles in industrial projects like petroleum refinery construction, I also gained valuable project coordination and leadership skills that complement my data science expertise. This fusion of insights from both spheres uniquely positions me to approach challenges with a holistic perspective, delivering effective and well-rounded solutions.

## Teaching and Academic Engagement

My journey in the world of Data Science extends beyond research and into education. Since 2017, I have been fortunate to serve as a lecturer at HEC Montreal. I have had the privilege of teaching and developping Data Science and Machine Learning courses to both undergraduate and graduate students. Guiding and inspiring the next generation of data scientists has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and I continue to foster a passion for learning and discovery within my students.
